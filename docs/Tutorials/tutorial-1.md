## IPO Essentials — Input ▸ Process ▸ Output  

Before any line of code is written, clarify three things: **what arrives from the user, what is done with it, and what must appear at the end.** The Input-Process-Output pattern keeps those elements in clear view and prevents logic from drifting.

### Using the IPO Lens  

| Phase      | Practical Meaning | Typical Keywords (in the problem text) |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Input**  | Data accepted from a user, file, sensor … — always *nouns*, never actions. | enter, read, get |
| **Process**| Operations applied to the inputs — arithmetic, decisions, loops. Each item should begin with a **verb**. | calculate, compute, determine, if, while, repeat |
| **Output** | The result delivered to the user or another system — again *nouns* or messages, no verbs. | display, print, show |

> **Reminder:** printing is not a process; it merely reveals the result of earlier calculations.
