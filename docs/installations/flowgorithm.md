## What is Flowgorithm

**Flowgorithm** is a free, open-source visual tool for creating, editing, and executing flowcharts as if they were real programs. Instead of writing code in a traditional text-based language, you drag and drop standard flowchart symbols (Start/End, Input/Output, Decision, Loop, etc.) onto a canvas, connect them with arrows, and then press `Run` to see your algorithm in action.

## Installing Flowgorithm

   1. Open your browser and go to https://flowgorithm.org
   
   2. Click the `Download` link in the top menu. Under `Windows Installer` section, click the `Windows 64-bit Installer` link and save the installer to your chosen folder.
   
   3. Double click the downloaded `.zip` folder. No need to unzip the folder first. Inside the folder, click the `Flowgorithm Installer`.
   
   4. `Select Installation Folder` : Choose any folder that you'd like.
   
   5. Click `Next` until you see the licence agreement, agree to the Terms and Conditions and click `Install`. That's it and you are good to go!
