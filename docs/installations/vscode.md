# VS Code

## What is VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor from Microsoft. It combines a clean, lightweight interface with powerful features that help you write, run, and debug code—all in one place.

Why we use VS Code in this course:

 - Built-in Python support (via Microsoft’s Python extension) gives you syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), and easy access to virtual environments.
 - Integrated terminal lets you run Git commands, Python scripts, or any shell commands without leaving the editor.
 - Built-in debugger makes it simple to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your Python code visually.

## Installing VS Code

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click Download for Windows.
2. Double-click the downloaded `VSCodeUserSetup-x64-*.exe`.

3. Select Additional Tasks: Maintain the defaults, but it is recommended to tick off the `Create a desktop icon` box.

4. Click `Install`, then `Finish`.
