#### CLO Usage Guidelines:

| Subject | Class Type | CLO to Use | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| **CP115** | **PRAKTIKUM (Labs)** | CLO2 or CLO3 | Always practical application |
| **CP115** | **LECTURE** | CLO1 | Always conceptual understanding |
| **CP115** | **TUTORIAL** | CLO1, CLO2, or both | Depends on content mix |
| **SC015** | **PRAKTIKUM (Labs)** | CLO3 | Always CLO3 for multimedia/database projects |

### Table Structure
```markdown
| # | Day/Time | Class | Subject | Mode | Topic | Learning Outcome | CLO | Reflection |
|---|----------|-------|---------|------|-------|------------------|-----|------------|
```

### Space-Saving Guidelines
- **Combined Lectures**: Lectures are shared between C01 and C02 classes, so combine them into single entries in the DIP table to save space
- **Example**: Instead of separate rows for C01 Lecture 1 and C02 Lecture 1, use one row with "C01 & C02" in the Class column

## Weekly Content Mapping

### Content Format Guidelines
- **Subject Column**: CP115 or SC015
- **Topics Column**: Only put topic names (e.g., "Topic 1: Introduction to Programming", "Topic 4: Multimedia", "Topic 5: Database")
- **Learning Outcome Column**: Copy exact text from schedule.md for CP115 or use SC015 specific learning outcomes
- **Reflection Column**: Must be suitable and relevant to the specific topic and learning outcome being taught

### SC015 Content by Week Period
**Week 1-9: Topic 4 - Multimedia**
- Learning Outcomes: 
  - (a) Identify five (5) multimedia elements (text, animation, graphic, audio, video)
  - (b) Produce multimedia project
- **Reflections**: Must focus on multimedia concepts only - element identification, project creation, technical challenges with multimedia integration

**Week 10 onwards: Topic 5 - Database**
- Learning Outcomes:
  - (a) Identify basic concepts of database
  - (b) Create a simple relational database project
- **Reflections**: Focus on database concepts - table relationships, normalization, query development

**Special Weeks (No SC015 Classes):**
- **Week 8 & 9**: Lab Test 1 - Show "Lab Test 1" in Topic and Learning Outcome columns, leave reflections empty
- **Week 15**: Lab Test 2 - Show "Lab Test 2" in Topic and Learning Outcome columns, leave reflections empty

### Week 1 Content Mapping
From schedule.md Week 1:
- **Lecture**: Course briefing + Topic 1: Introduction to Programming - (a) Identify programming concepts
- **Tutorial**: Course briefing 
- **Praktikum**: Course briefing

### Week 2 Content Mapping  
From schedule.md Week 2:
- **Lecture**: Topic 1: Introduction to Programming - (b) List five (5) steps in problem solving + Topic 2: Problem Analysis - (a) Define the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model
- **Tutorial**: Topic 1: Introduction to Programming - (c) Explain five (5) steps in problem solving
- **Praktikum**: Topic 1: Introduction to Programming - (d) Demonstrate use of design software and coding platforms

*(Continue mapping based on schedule.md)*

## Reflection Writing Guidelines

### Topic-Specific Reflections:
Reflections must be relevant to the specific topic and learning outcome. Match reflection content to what students are actually learning.

### Tone and Variety:
- Mix positive and realistic reflections
- Include some challenges students face
- Use generic, professional language
- Make reflections specific to the topic and learning outcome

### Examples by Topic/Learning Outcome:

#### Course Briefing:
- **Good**: "Students understand the course structure, assessment methods, and expectations clearly"
- **Realistic**: "Some students need clarification on assessment weightages and submission procedures"
- **Mixed**: "Most students grasp the course overview, though some require additional explanation of practical requirements"

#### Topic 1 - (a) Identify programming concepts:
- **Good**: "Students can identify basic programming concepts and terminology effectively"
- **Realistic**: "Students have difficulty distinguishing between different programming paradigms initially" 
- **Mixed**: "Most students understand fundamental concepts, though some struggle with abstract programming terminology"

#### Topic 1 - (c) Explain five (5) steps in problem solving:
- **Good**: "Students can systematically apply the five problem-solving steps to given scenarios"
- **Realistic**: "Students find it challenging to break down complex problems into manageable steps"
- **Mixed**: "Most students understand the problem-solving methodology, though some need practice applying it consistently"

#### Topic 1 - (d) Demonstrate use of design software and coding platforms:
- **Good**: "Students successfully navigate and utilize programming environments and design tools"
- **Realistic**: "Students experience initial difficulties with software installation and interface navigation"

#### Topic 5 - (d) Apply the IPO model, pseudocode and flowchart (sequence):
- **Good**: "Students successfully apply the IPO model and can create effective sequential flowcharts for problem-solving"
- **Realistic**: "Students struggle with translating complex problems into clear sequential flowchart format"
- **Mixed**: "Most students understand sequential logic, though some struggle with translating problems into flowchart format"

#### Topic 6 - (c) Identify relational and logical operators in selection structures:
- **Good**: "Students can explain the concepts of selection structures and apply logical operators in different programming scenarios"

## File Naming Convention
- `week-[number]-dip.md`
- Example: `week-1-dip.md`, `week-2-dip.md`

## Navigation Integration
Update `.vitepress/config.mjs` to add new DIP weeks:
```javascript
{
  text: 'Daily Induction Plans',
  items: [
    { text: 'Week 1 DIP', link: '/course/DIP/week-1-dip' },
    { text: 'Week 2 DIP', link: '/course/DIP/week-2-dip' },
    // Add more weeks as needed
  ]
}
```
