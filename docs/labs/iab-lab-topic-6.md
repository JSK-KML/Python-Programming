# Bengkel ToT Chapter 6 : List

## Overview

A **list** is a data structure that stores a collection of values in a single variable, kept in order. Where an ordinary variable holds one value, a list holds many, and provides operations to access, modify, and process those values as a group. Lists are one of the most widely used structures in **Python**.

### Learning Outcomes

### Before You Begin

Open a file called `exercise.py`. In each section, type the example code, run it, and confirm your output matches the expected output shown before attempting the exercises.

## What Is a List?

A list is a collection of items stored in a single variable. It allows the storage of multiple values, which may be of different data types.

A list is written using **square brackets** `[ ]`. The values inside are called **elements**, and they are separated by commas.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
print(fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']
```

In this list, the name is `fruits` and there are three elements, so the size of the list is three.

### List vs Primitive Data Type

A primitive data type, such as an integer or a string, holds a single value. A list holds many values, which may be of different types.

| Feature | List | Primitive data type |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| Stores | multiple values | a single value |
| Data type | can hold different data types | holds only one data type |
| Structure | uses `[ ]` brackets | no brackets |
| Example | `numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]` | `number = 10` |

### What Data Can Be Stored in a List?

Any data type can be stored in a list.

**Integers:**

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

**Floats:**

```python
decimal_numbers = [1.5, 2.3, 3.7, 4.1]
print(decimal_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[1.5, 2.3, 3.7, 4.1]
```

**Strings:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
```

**Booleans:**

```python
status = [True, False, True, False]
print(status)
```

**Output:**
```
[True, False, True, False]
```

**Mixed data types:** a single list can hold values of different types at the same time.

```python
mixed_list = [25, "hello", 3.14, True]
print(mixed_list)
```

**Output:**
```
[25, 'hello', 3.14, True]
```

A list can also be created **empty**, ready to be filled later:

```python
cart = []
print(cart)
```

**Output:**
```
[]
```

### Characteristics of a List

A list has five key characteristics:

- **Ordered** — elements are stored in a specific sequence.
- **Mutable** — elements can be added, removed, or changed after the list is created.
- **Allows Duplicates** — the same value may appear more than once.
- **Supports Different Data Types** — a single list can store integers, strings, floats, or booleans together.
- **Dynamic Size** — a list can grow or shrink as needed.

::: tip
Being **mutable** and **dynamic** is what makes a list so useful: you can start with an empty list and keep adding to it as your program runs, which you will do with the `append()` method later in this session.
:::

### Exercises <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />

1. Create a list called `colours` containing four colours of your choice, then print it.
2. Create a list called `temperatures` containing the values `36.5, 37.2, 36.8, 37.0`, then print it.
3. Create a list called `profile` that holds a name (text), an age (number), and whether the person is a student (`True` or `False`). Print it.
4. Create an empty list called `wishlist` and print it.

## List Indexing

Each element in a list has a position, called its **index**.

### Positive Index

Indexing starts at **0**, not 1. The first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on, counting from left to right.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[2])
```

**Output:**
```
apple
kiwi
```

| element | "apple" | "banana" | "kiwi" |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| positive index | 0 | 1 | 2 |

Because indexing starts at `0`, the last element of this three-element list is at index `2`, not `3`. Using an index that does not exist produces an error:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
print(fruits[5])
```

**Output:**
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

### Negative Index

Elements can also be accessed from the **end** of the list using negative indexes. The last element is at index `-1`, the second-to-last at `-2`, counting from right to left.

```python
cities = ["Kuala Lumpur", "Tokyo", "New York", "Paris", "Dubai"]
print(cities[-1])
print(cities[-3])
```

**Output:**
```
Dubai
New York
```

| element | "apple" | "banana" | "kiwi" | "durian" | "guava" | "orange" |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| positive index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| negative index | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |

5. Write down the positive index and the negative index that both refer to `"English"`.

### Exercises: Problem Solving <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />

6. A shop displays a chosen product together with the ones on either side of it on the shelf. Using the price list `prices = [45, 88, 62, 91, 77]`, ask the user to enter a position between `1` and `3`. Using indexing only, display the price at that position, the price **before** it, and the price **after** it.

**Sample Input** (the position the user types):
```
2
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Chosen: 62
Before: 88
After: 91
```

## Looping Through a List

Reaching one element at a time with an index works, but most of the time you want to visit **every** element in a list. A loop does this for you. There are three common ways to loop through a list.

### For-Each Loop

The simplest way is a `for` loop that takes each element in turn. You do **not** need to know the length of the list or set any limit — the loop automatically runs once for every element, from the first to the last, and stops on its own.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
#   item      the list
#    ↓          ↓
for item in fruits:
    print(item)
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
kiwi
```

Read it as: "for each `item` in `fruits`". The loop runs three times, once for each element. On the first pass `item` is `"apple"`, on the second `"banana"`, on the third `"kiwi"`. Note that `item` holds the **value** of the element, not its index.

A for-each loop always runs in **one direction only** — from the first element to the last. You cannot reverse it, and you cannot skip specific elements. It also does not give you the **index** of each element, only its value. This makes it the best choice when you simply need to visit every element and do something with each one. For example, this adds up every number in a list:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total = 0
for number in numbers:
    total = total + number
print("Total:", total)
```

**Output:**
```
Total: 100
```

Each pass takes the next number and adds it to `total`, so after the loop `total` holds the sum of the whole list.

### For Loop with Index

When you need the **index** of each element — not just its value — loop over the positions instead. Combine `range()` and `len()`, then use the index to reach each element with `fruits[i]`.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(i, fruits[i])
```

**Output:**
```
0 apple
1 banana
2 kiwi
```

`len(fruits)` is `3`, so `range(len(fruits))` produces `0, 1, 2`, and `fruits[i]` reaches each element by its index.

Having the index is what makes this loop more powerful than for-each. Because you know each element's position, you can decide what to do based on the position itself — for example, printing only the elements at **even index positions** (`0`, `2`, `4`, ...):

```python
names = ["Ali", "Sara", "Kumar", "Lee", "Wong"]
for i in range(len(names)):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, names[i])
```

**Output:**
```
0 Ali
2 Kumar
4 Wong
```

A for-each loop could not do this, because it never gives you the index `i` to test.

The index also lets you compare an element with its **neighbour** — the element just before it, at index `i - 1`. This example prints a message whenever a temperature is higher than the day before it:

```python
temps = [25, 27, 26, 30]
for i in range(len(temps)):
    if i > 0 and temps[i] > temps[i - 1]:
        print("Day", i, "was warmer than the day before")
```

**Output:**
```
Day 1 was warmer than the day before
Day 3 was warmer than the day before
```

The check `i > 0` is important: the very first element (index `0`) has no element before it, so there is nothing to compare it against.

### While Loop

A `while` loop keeps its own counter and repeats as long as a condition is true. To visit a list, the counter starts at `0` and increases each pass, stopping when it reaches the length of the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
i = 0
while i < len(fruits):
    print(fruits[i])
    i = i + 1
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
kiwi
```

For simply walking through a whole list, a `while` loop offers no advantage over the `for` loops above. Its usefulness is the **flexibility of its condition**: you control exactly when it stops, so it can end early. For example, this stops as soon as it finds a number above `100`:

```python
numbers = [20, 45, 130, 60, 200]
i = 0
while i < len(numbers) and numbers[i] <= 100:
    print(numbers[i])
    i = i + 1
```

**Output:**
```
20
45
```

The loop stops at `130` because the condition `numbers[i] <= 100` becomes false, so the remaining elements are never visited.

::: tip
- **For-each** — visit every element, value only. Simplest and clearest.
- **For with index** — when you need each element's position, to compare with neighbours or skip positions.
- **While** — when the stopping point is a condition, not simply the end of the list.
:::

### Exercises: Basic <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />

Use the list `numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23]` for these.

1. Use a for-each loop to print every number in the list.
2. Use a `for` loop with an index to print each number together with its index position.
3. Use a `while` loop to print every number in the list.

4. A teacher wants to know how many students passed an exam. A pass is a score of `60` or above. Given `scores = [85, 45, 72, 60, 38, 90]`, use a loop to count how many students passed, and display the count.

**Sample Output:**
```
Students who passed: 4
```

5. A school converts marks into grades. Given `marks = [85, 62, 47, 90, 73, 38]`, use a loop to build a **new list** of grades, where each mark becomes `"A"` (75 and above), `"P"` (50 to 74), or `"F"` (below 50). Print the resulting list of grades.

**Sample Output:**
```
Grades: ['A', 'P', 'F', 'A', 'P', 'F']
```

6. An image processing app analyses a row of pixels stored as grayscale values (0 is black, 255 is white). It needs to count the **bright spots** — pixels that are brighter than **both** their left and right neighbours. Given `pixels = [100, 120, 200, 150, 180, 160, 140]`, use a loop to count the bright spots and display the total. (The first and last pixels have only one neighbour, so they can never be a bright spot.)

**Sample Output:**
```
Bright spots: 2
```

7. A cinema row is stored as `seats = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`, where `0` is an empty seat and `1` is taken. A couple needs **two empty seats next to each other**. Use a loop to check whether any two adjacent seats are both empty, and print `True` or `False`.

**Sample Output:**
```
True
```

## List Operations

Basic list operations include creating a list and updating its elements.

### Creating a List

A list can be created empty, or with elements already inside it.

```python
shopping = []
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
temperatures = [36.5, 37.2, 36.8, 37.0]
```

### Updating a List

A list is **mutable**: its elements can be changed after it is created. To change an element, assign a new value to it through its index.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
print(fruits)

fruits[1] = "orange"
print(fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']
['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi']
```

Updating also works with negative indexes:

```python
cities = ["KL", "Penang", "JB", "Malacca"]
cities[-1] = "Ipoh"
cities[-3] = "Shah Alam"
print(cities)
```

**Output:**
```
['KL', 'Shah Alam', 'JB', 'Ipoh']
```

6. A warehouse restocks any product whose stock has run low. Given the stock list `stock = [12, 25, 8, 30, 15]`, add `5` units to every item that is **below 20**, leaving the others unchanged. Print the updated list.

**Sample Output:**
```
Updated stock: [17, 25, 13, 30, 20]
```

7. A school records exam marks and applies a rule: any **failing mark** (below 40) is recorded as `0`. Given `marks = [55, 38, 72, 41, 29, 90]`, replace every failing mark with `0`, then print the updated list.

**Sample Output:**
```
Updated marks: [55, 0, 72, 41, 0, 90]
```

## Pre-defined List Functions

**Python** provides several built-in **functions** that give information about a list. A function is used by writing its name and placing the list inside the brackets.

### The len() Function

`len()` returns the number of elements in a list.

```python
carlist = ["Saga", "Waja", "Wira", "Persona"]
print("Length of the list:", len(carlist))
```

**Output:**
```
Length of the list: 4
```

### The min() and max() Functions

`min()` returns the smallest element and `max()` returns the largest.

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 6]
print("Minimum value:", min(numbers))
print("Maximum value:", max(numbers))
```

**Output:**
```
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 8
```

With strings, `min()` and `max()` compare alphabetically. `min()` returns the word first in alphabetical order, `max()` the word last.

```python
string_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print("Minimum string:", min(string_list))
print("Maximum string:", max(string_list))
```

**Output:**
```
Minimum string: apple
Maximum string: date
```

These functions require the elements to be of a comparable type. A list that mixes numbers and text causes an error:

```python
list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 50]
print(min(list1))
```

**Output:**
```
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
```

::: danger ATTENTION
`min()`, `max()`, and `sum()` must compare or add the elements, and **Python** cannot decide whether a number is smaller or larger than a piece of text. To use these functions, the list must contain values of a **single comparable type** — all numbers, or all strings.
:::

### The sum() Function

`sum()` adds up all the numeric values in a list and returns the total.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Sum of all elements:", sum(numbers))
```

**Output:**
```
Sum of all elements: 15
```

### Exercises: Basic <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />

1. Create the list `ages = [21, 34, 18, 45, 27]`. Print how many ages there are, the youngest age, and the oldest age.

3. Create the list `words = ["mango", "apple", "durian", "banana"]`. Print the word that comes first alphabetically and the word that comes last.

### Exercises: Problem Solving <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />

4. A teacher enters five students' marks and wants a summary. Ask the user to enter five marks into a list, then use the built-in functions to display the total, the average, the highest, and the lowest mark.

**Sample Input** (five marks):
```
60
85
47
90
73
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Total: 355
Average: 71.0
Highest: 90
Lowest: 47
```

5. A teacher records exam scores and needs a summary report showing the class average, how many students **passed** (scored 60 or above), and how many **failed**. Given `scores = [85, 92, 58, 74, 66, 91]`, use `sum()` and `len()` for the average, then a loop to count the passes and fails. Display all three.

**Sample Output:**
```
Average: 77.7
Passing: 5
Failed: 1
```

### Function vs Method

Everything in this section so far has been a **function**. The next two sections use **methods** instead. The two are written differently:

| | How it is written | Where the list goes | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Function** | `name(list)` | inside the brackets | `len(carlist)` |
| **Method** | `list.name()` | before the dot | `carlist.append(...)` |

A function wraps the list; a method hangs off the list after a dot.

## The append() Method

The `append()` method adds a single element to the **end** of a list. It modifies the list in place.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

This is useful together with an empty list: a list can be built up one element at a time, often inside a loop.

```python
number_list = []
for i in range(5):
    number_list.append(i)
print(number_list)
```

**Output:**
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

An element can also be appended only when it meets a condition:

```python
even_numbers = []
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(i)
print(even_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Exercises: Basic <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />

1. Create an empty list `shopping`. Append four items to it, then print the list.

3. A weather station logs six daily temperatures and wants to collect only the **hot** days (30 and above) into a separate list. Ask the user to enter six temperatures, one at a time. Append only the hot ones to a `hot` list, then print it.

**Sample Input** (six temperatures):
```
28
32
29
35
31
27
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Hot days: [32, 35, 31]
```

4. A shop only accepts items priced RM50 or below. Ask the user to enter six prices, one at a time. Append the accepted ones (RM50 or below) to a list, and count how many were **rejected** (above RM50). Print the accepted list and the number rejected.

**Sample Input** (six prices):
```
30
75
45
90
20
60
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Accepted: [30, 45, 20]
Rejected: 3
```

## The sort() Method

The `sort()` method rearranges the elements of a list into order. By default it sorts in **ascending** order, from smallest to largest.

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

Passing `reverse=True` sorts in **descending** order, from largest to smallest.

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]
```

`sort()` also orders strings alphabetically.

```python
fruits = ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "date"]
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)

fruits.sort(reverse=True)
print(fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
['date', 'cherry', 'banana', 'apple']
```

3. A race records finishing times. Given `times = [45, 32, 58, 29, 41, 37]`, sort the times, then display the **fastest three** times (the first three after sorting) and the winner (the fastest of all).

**Sample Output:**
```
Fastest three times: [29, 32, 37]
Winner's time: 29
```

::: tip
This combines two ideas: `sort()` puts the list in order, and indexing lets you pick out the first few positions once it is sorted.
:::

4. **Combined exercise — Test Scores.** Ask the user to enter five test scores, appending each into a list. Then display the full list, the number of scores, the highest and lowest score, the total, the average, and finally the scores sorted from highest to lowest.

**Sample Input** (the five scores the user types):
```
55
90
72
48
83
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Scores: [55, 90, 72, 48, 83]
Number of scores: 5
Highest: 90
Lowest: 48
Total: 348
Average: 69.6
Sorted (highest to lowest): [90, 83, 72, 55, 48]
```

5. **Combined exercise — Price Check.** Ask the user to enter six prices into a list. Then display the number of prices, the cheapest and most expensive price, the total cost, and the prices sorted from lowest to highest. Finally, append a seventh price entered by the user, sort the list again, and display the updated list with its new total.

**Sample Input** (six prices, then one more to add):
```
12.90
4.50
25.00
8.75
15.60
3.20
9.99
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Number of prices: 6
Cheapest: 3.2
Most expensive: 25.0
Total: 69.95
Sorted: [3.2, 4.5, 8.75, 12.9, 15.6, 25.0]
Updated list: [3.2, 4.5, 8.75, 9.99, 12.9, 15.6, 25.0]
New total: 79.94
```
