# Lab 02 : Flowgorithm and More Github

## Pull and Update in VS Code

This lab will explain how to use Flowgorithm and how to integrate Flowgorithm with Github

Before starting any lab, you need to make sure that the repo in your Github is the latest one. [Sync the repo](./lab-01.md#syncing-fork) if the `upstream` repo have been updated.

Syncing the repo only updates the online repo that exist in Github web server. Back in our VS Code, the code are unchanged from the last time you used it. 

Once the online repo is in-sync, bring those changes down to your PC by clicking `Source Control` and then `...` beside `Changes` and click `Pull`.

`Pull` connects to the project on Github, grabs any commits added since your last `Pull`, and blends those changes into your PC so your local files and history now match what’s online on Github server.

## Introduction to Flowgorithm

Flowgorithm is a program that lets you draw an algorithm as a flowchart and then watch it run step-by-step. Each shape (start, input, decision, loop, etc.) represents one action in your logic, so you can see what happens to your variables without writing any code first. When you’re ready, Flowgorithm can even show the matching Python code so you can relate the picture to real code.

Launch Flowgorithm by pressing <kbd style="color:#1B1B1F; border:1px solid #e64a1e; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px; background:#FF5522; box-shadow:inset 0 -2px 0 #c4401a;">⊞ Win</kbd> on your keyboard and type *Flowgorithm*.
