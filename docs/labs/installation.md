# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing the essential tools needed for this Python programming course. You'll need **Git** for version control, **VS Code** as your code editor, and **Flowgorithm** for creating visual flowcharts.

## Git

### What is Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system that records every change you make to your code, lets you rewind to any previous state, and supports branching so you can safely experiment without affecting your `main` work.

Why we use **Git** (and **GitHub**) instead of **Google Classroom**:

- Real-world practice: Professional developers worldwide rely on **Git** daily. By learning **Git** here, you acquire skills you'll use in internships, labs, and future jobs.

- Instant, automated feedback: Every push triggers our Continuous Integration checks (tests, style reviews), so you see errors or suggestions immediately rather than waiting for manual grading.

- Complete history & easy rollback: Unlike a one-off upload, **Git** preserves the full history of your edits. Made a mistake? You can revert to any prior version with a single command.

- Collaboration & peer review: **GitHub's** pull-request workflow lets you review classmates' code, discuss improvements inline, and learn from each other in a transparent, controlled way.

### Installing Git

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win — the download should begin automatically.

2. Double-click the downloaded `Git-version-64-bit.exe` file and click `Next` on the welcome screen.

3. `Select Destination Location`: You can accept the default or choose any locations that you like.

4. `Select Components`: Leave everything as is.

5. `Choosing the default editor used by Git`: Choose the default. 
   
6. `Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories`: Choose the default. 
   
7. `Adjusting your PATH environment`: Choose `Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software.`

::: info NOTE
The PATH environment variable in **Windows** tells the system where to look for executable programs when you type a command in command prompt. If you ever see this option again, it's almost always a good idea to tick off the box.
:::

8. `Choosing the SSH executable`: Choose the default.
   
9. `Choosing HTTPS transport backend`: Leave `Use the OpenSSL library`
    
10. `Configuring line endings`: Choose `Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings.`
    
11. `Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash`: Choose `Use MinTTY.`
    
12. `Choose the default behaviour of git pull`: Choose the default
    
13. `Choose the credential helper`: Choose `Git Credential Manager`.
    
14. `Configuring extra options`: Choose the default.
    
15. Click `Install`, it should take a few minutes and you are good to go!

## VS Code

### What is VS Code

**Visual Studio Code** (**VS Code**) is a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor from **Microsoft**. It combines a clean, lightweight interface with powerful features that help you write, run, and debug code—all in one place.

Why we use **VS Code** in this course:

- Built-in **Python** support (via **Microsoft's** **Python** extension) gives you syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), and easy access to virtual environments.
- Integrated terminal lets you run **Git** commands, **Python** scripts, or any shell commands without leaving the editor.
- Built-in debugger makes it simple to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your **Python** code visually.

### Installing VS Code

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click `Download for Windows`.
   
2. Double-click the downloaded `VSCodeUserSetup-x64-*.exe`.

3. `Select Additional Tasks`: Maintain the defaults, but it is recommended to tick off the `Create a desktop icon` box.

4. Click `Install`, then `Finish`.

## Flowgorithm

### What is Flowgorithm

**Flowgorithm** is a free, open-source visual tool for creating, editing, and executing flowcharts as if they were real programs. Instead of writing code in a traditional text-based language, you drag and drop standard flowchart symbols (Start/End, Input/Output, Decision, Loop, etc.) onto a canvas, connect them with arrows, and then press `Run` to see your algorithm in action.

### Installing Flowgorithm

1. Open your browser and go to https://flowgorithm.org
   
2. Click the `Download` link in the top menu. Under `Windows Installer` section, click the `Windows 64-bit Installer` link and save the installer to your chosen folder.
   
3. Double click the downloaded `.zip` folder. No need to unzip the folder first. Inside the folder, click the `Flowgorithm Installer`.
   
4. `Select Installation Folder`: Choose any folder that you'd like.
   
5. Click `Next` until you see the licence agreement, agree to the Terms and Conditions and click `Install`. That's it and you are good to go!
