Each shape (start, input, decision, loop, etc.) represents one action in your logic, so you can see what happens to your variables without writing any code first. When you’re ready, Flowgorithm can even show the matching Python code so you can relate the picture to real code.</p><p>Launch Flowgorithm by pressing <kbd style="color:#1B1B1F;border:1px solid #e64a1e;padding:2px 6px;border-radius:4px;background:#FF5522;box-shadow:inset 0 -2px 0 #c4401a;">⊞ Win</kbd> on your keyboard and type <em>Flowgorithm</em>.
