Each shape (start, input, decision, loop, etc.) represents one action in your logic, so you can see what happens to your variables without writing any code first. When you’re ready, Flowgorithm can even show the matching Python code so you can relate the picture to real code.</p><p>Launch Flowgorithm by pressing <kbd style="color:#fff;background:#0047A3;border:1px solid #0060CC;padding:4px 10px;border-radius:6px;box-shadow:inset 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.45),0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.25);font-size:.85em;line-height:1;user-select:none;">⊞ Win</kbd> on your keyboard and type <em>Flowgorithm</em>. If you can&#39;t see it make sure you have <a href="/Python-Programming/installations/flowgorithm.html">installed it.</a></p><p>When you first launch it, you will see a simple flowchart, containing only <code>Start</code> and <code>End</code>. This is the default template of the any Flowgorithm projects. Before we edit the file, we need to save the file first.</p><p>To know if the file is still unsaved, the name of the file is still callled <code>(Untitled)</code>. To save the file, click <code>File</code> and then <code>Save As...</code>. The system will prompt you on the location of the file you want it saved. Saved it to any location you are comfortable with. Remember this location, you will need to use this later. Named the file exactly as this; <code>lab-2</code>.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+d+'" alt="drawing" width="400"></p><h3 id="creating-our-first-flowchart" tabindex="-1">Creating Our First Flowchart <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-our-first-flowchart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating Our First Flowchart&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Hover your mouse on the arrow that is connecting <code>Main</code> and <code>End</code> until the arrow turns orange, then left click on the arrow.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+p+'" alt="drawing" width="400"></p><p>After you right click on in, you will see a window popup, listing all the shapes that you can add into your flowchart.

For this example, lets use <a href="./../tutorials/chapter-2-tutorial-1.html#scenario-1-meal-price-with-taxes">Scenario 1</a> from our Chapter 2 - Tutorial 1.</p><p>For this exercise, we are focusing on how to use Flowgorithm not how to create a correct flowchart. The usage of the shapes might be not the most accurate way, but take it easy. This exercise is emphasizing on the software.</p><p>Lets recall Scenario 1 from Chapter 2 - Tutorial 1 :</p><blockquote><p>A government tax of 10% and service tax of 5% will be added to the price of a set of meal bought at MFC. Calculate the total price that Ali has to pay for a set of meal.

So if you want to add a new shape in between the two old shape, click the line in between those two shapes. Now lets change the input in the <code>Input</code> shapes. Double click the <code>Input</code> shapes until a window appear that ask you to enter the variable name.
