Consider storing repeated characters: instead of storing &quot;aaabbc&quot; as six separate characters, we can represent it more efficiently as &quot;a3b2c1&quot; - indicating 3 a&#39;s, 2 b&#39;s, and 1 c.</p><p>Run-Length Encoding operates on this principle by identifying sequences of repeated characters.

However, compression effectiveness increases with repetition.
