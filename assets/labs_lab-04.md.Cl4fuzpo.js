In <strong>Flowgorithm</strong>, it is the same. Before we start using the diamond shapes, lets use one example from <a href="./../tutorials/chapter-3-tutorial-3.html">Tutorial 3</a> for us to implement in <strong>Flowgorithm</strong></p><blockquote><p>MyHealth magazine is sold at RM5.00 each if at least 5 units of the magazine are purchased, and it is sold at the price of RM7.00 each otherwise. Calculate the price a customer has to pay after they enter the quantity of the magazines that they purchased.</p></blockquote><p>Lets skip the <code>Input</code> shape and <code>Declare</code> shape for the questions, if you forgot how to do that, you can refer back <a href="./lab-03.html#creating-input-and-output">here</a>.</p><p>After declaring input and accepting input from the user, you will got this</p><p align="center"><img src="'+d+'" alt="drawing" width="300"></p><p>You have one input, the <code>magazinesNumber</code>.This is a simple selection (if–else) problem: if <code>magazinesNumber</code> ≥ 5, the unit price is RM5.00. Otherwise, the unit price is RM7.00. Note the boundary case that &quot;at least 5&quot; , so you must includes 5.</p><p>Now that we have establish the structure of the algorithm, we have discovered a new variable, which is <code>unitPrice</code>. Declare the variable using the <code>Declare</code> shape just under the input.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+h+'" alt="drawing" width="300"></p><p>The selection will be added after the <code>unitPrice</code> have been declared, The reason we did this is so that we only need to declare it once. If we declared the variable after the selection, we will have to declare it two times, one after the <code>True</code> condition and one after the <code>False</code> condition.</p><p>To add the selection, click the arrow underneath <code>unitPrice</code> and a popup window will open. Under the <strong>Control</strong> section, click the <code>Diamond</code> shape.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+p+'" alt="drawing" width="500"></p><p>The <code>Diamond</code> shape will automatically have two arrow coming out of them. The left one is for false and the right one for true.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+g+'" alt="drawing" width="300"></p><p>Double click the <code>Diamond</code> shape and a popup window will appear that will prompt you to enter condition of the expression. For our questions, we will enter <code>magazineNumber &gt;= 5</code> as our condition.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+u+'" alt="drawing" width="400"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>Only variable that have been declared can be used in the conditions. Make sure you declared all the necessary variable that you are going to need. Any condition inside the <code>Diamond</code> must be either evaluated to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p></div><p>Now we need to add the logic for both paths of the selection:</p><p><strong>True Path (Right Side):</strong> If <code>magazineNumber &gt;= 5</code> is <strong>True</strong>, this means the customer is buying 5 or more magazines, so they get the discounted price. We need to set <code>unitPrice = 5</code>.</p><p><strong>False Path (Left Side):</strong> If <code>magazineNumber &gt;= 5</code> is <strong>False</strong>, this means the customer is buying fewer than 5 magazines, so they pay the regular price. We need to set <code>unitPrice = 7</code>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>True</strong> arrow (right side) and add an <code>Assign</code> shape. Set the assignment to <code>unitPrice = 5</code>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>False</strong> arrow (left side) and add an <code>Assign</code> shape. Set the assignment to <code>unitPrice = 7</code>.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+m+'" alt="drawing" width="400"></p><p>After both paths, the flowchart will merge back together (note the circle connector in the image), and you can continue with calculating the total price by multiplying <code>unitPrice</code> with <code>magazineNumber</code>.</p><p>After the selection structure, we need to complete the flowchart. First, declare a new variable called <code>finalPrice</code> using the <code>Declare</code> shape to store the calculated total cost.</p><p>Next, add an <code>Assign</code> shape to calculate the final price using the formula <code>finalPrice = magazineNumber * unitPrice</code>. This will multiply the number of magazines by the unit price we determined from the selection.</p><p>Finally, add an <code>Output</code> shape to display the <code>finalPrice</code> to the user.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+w+'" alt="drawing" width="400"></p><p>The complete flowchart shows how the selection structure works:</p><ul><li>The diamond shape evaluates the condition <code>magazineNumber &gt;= 5</code></li><li>If <strong>True</strong> (right path): <code>unitPrice = 5</code></li><li>If <strong>False</strong> (left path): <code>unitPrice = 7</code></li><li>Both paths merge back together at the circle connector</li><li>Then the final calculation and output steps are executed</li></ul><h2 id="exporting-flowgorithm-to-image" tabindex="-1">Exporting Flowgorithm to Image <a class="header-anchor" href="#exporting-flowgorithm-to-image" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exporting Flowgorithm to Image&quot;">​</a></h2><p>At the top bar, click <strong>Tools &gt; Export to an Image file</strong>.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+b+'" alt="drawing" width="400"></p><p>After you click it, a popup window will appear, no need to change anything and just click <strong>Create</strong> atthe bottom right of the window.</p><p>Then it will prompt you the location that you want the image saved and the name of the image.
